      <p>EPISODE I</p>
      <h1>A New Hope</h1>
      <p>
<br>
<br>
        It is a dark time for the galaxy.  
A mysterious new force, rising from the forgotten regions beyond the Outer Rim,  
has begun to spread fear and chaos across star systems once considered safe.  
<br>
<br>
The Jedi, few and scattered, struggle to restore balance as ancient secrets  
and forbidden powers are uncovered. The New Republic, still recovering from  
the scars of past wars, faces internal division and growing unrest.  
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the shadows of deep space, a rogue warrior known only as The Wraith  
has begun hunting Force-sensitive individuals, seeking to harness their power  
for an unknown purpose that could shift the fate of the galaxy forever.
